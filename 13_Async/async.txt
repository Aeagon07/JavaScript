there is a catch..

Javascript is single thread langaugue means every code you see is execute by the single code

JS -> shows the synchronous structure of the code..
each operation is waot until the first operation is execute 

Blocking Code vs Non-Blocking Code =>

BC => Block the flow of the program e.g., Read file synchronously
NBC => Does not block execution e.g., Read File Async

There is no such like non-blocking code is best or blocking code is the best
every type of the code has it's own use cases

BC use case -> if you want to register in the form but before completion of 
the form you get the successful message of completion of the student 
registeration let say so, it is not good
