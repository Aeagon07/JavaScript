This is full summary on your topic datatypes based on the interview perspective...

How you can store your data in your meomery and how you access on that basis there are two types of datatypes

 1) Primitives => they all are the call by value... (total = 7)
**Call By Value -> hame unka original reference nahi diya unne copy karke hamre pass aate hai

    a) String
    b) Number
    c) Boolean
    d) Null
    e) Undefined(value assign nahi hai meomery space allocation hai)
    f) Symbol
    g) bigInt

2) Reference (Non-primitives) => they are call by reference
 
    Arrays, Objects, Functions

**
Javascript is Dyanmically Typed langauge so you don't need to define the type of variable...
(#Rust or Typescript are Static Typed langauge)

**
Symbol:
const id = Symbol('123')
const custId = Symbol('123')

console.log(id === custId) => false...

even they both having same values but they are not same cause due to Symbol.
It create variable unique even they having same values..

**
bigInt:
let bigNumber = 123432892n => just add n at the last

**
Non-primitives datatypes :

Arrays => const heros = ["Shaktiman", "Krish", "Naagraj", "Balveer"]

Objects => 
let myObj = {
                name: "Rushikesh",
                age: 20,
            }

Functions => there are different types of writting a function in Javascript
variable approach :-

const myFunction = function(){
    console.log("Hello")
}

**
what value give by the typeof operator?

1) Undefined => "undefined"
2) Null =>      "object"
3) Boolean =>   "boolean" 
4) Number =>    "number"
5) String =>    "string"

a) Object(native and does not impl.([call]) ) => "object"
a) Object(native or host and impl.([call]) ) => "function"
a) Object(host and does not impl.([call]) ) => "Implementation-defined except may not be "userdefined", "Boolean", "number" or "string"

jitne bhi non premitive data type hai unka object hi type aata hai but function ka function aata hai usse ham function-object bol te hai

**
Ex-Ans :-

1) id           =>   Symbol(123)
2) custId       =>   Symbol(123)
3) heros        =>   object(Array)
4) myObj        =>   object(Object)
5) myFunction   =>   function
6) score        =>   Number(23)
7) scoreValue   =>   Number(100.7)
8) isLogged     =>   Boolean(false)
9) outsideTemp  =>   Object(null)
10) userEmail   =>   Undefined
