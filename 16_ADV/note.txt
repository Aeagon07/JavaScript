call stack maintained by every function when you enter into the meomery or execution contest

In execution contest the bottom most is the Global EC and then all the fucntion goes top of GEC 

cenario is when you have function and withing that we call another function called as callme() then in EC whose this keyword refer?

where this indicate cause the outer layer of the callme is function but this not refer to funtion..
So in such situation this ref to the Global EC..

IN GEC there is problem -> when you have window object then it ref to window object {window(this window)} but the problem when you have node enviroment then this -> {} empty object

this is still problem but with react it dimonilised but still it is problem in js
